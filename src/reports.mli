(** [pp] pretty-print weekly team reports.

    [include_krs] only includes this list of KR IDs. Note that this will ignore
    empty KR IDs or KRs marked as "NEW KR" unless specified in the list. If the
    list is empty, all KRs are returned.

    When [show_time_calc] is set, an extra line will be added to the output each
    time the same entry is included in the report with a sum at the end. This is
    useful for showing the intermediate steps when aggreating multiple reports
    that contain the same KR.

    [show_time] shows the time entries [show_engineers] shows the list of
    engineers *)
